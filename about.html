            <p class="mb-20">
              The Philippine Frontline Ministries, Inc. (or Frontline), founded
              and led by Jeff and Rowena Pessina, has been serving the Filipino
              people and nation for nearly 35 years. From humble beginnings of
              just a few young people armed with little more than vision and
              faith, Frontline has reached millions of people nationwide with
              the Gospel through a variety of means.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-20">
              The roots of the ministry actually go back to the late 1970's,
              when attempts were made by Christ is the Answer Crusades, Inc. to
              establish a permanent work in this island nation. For a number of
              reasons, both of these attempts failed. In 1980 Jeff Pessina was
              invited to assist in what would be the third attempt. In the years
              that followed a small mission-team was established with relative
              success. A number of evangelistic tent crusades were conducted in
              various towns and cities on the northern island of Luzon. However,
              in 1985, due again to financial, practical, and spiritual matters,
              the success of a long term mission work faltered and faced
              unlikely odds of success.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-20">
              However, the call of God to reach and impact the nation for Christ
              was real and was not to be given up. Though facing many
              yet-to-be-known trials and struggles ahead, Jeff accepted the
              leadership role and carried on in faith to build and lead a team
              to what eventually became an established, registered ministry,
              that would go on to reach millions of Filipinos with the Gospel
              over the next 20 years.

            />
            <p class="mb-20">
              During these 20 years, the Frontline team lived on the road
              year-round in a mobile camp of tents and trailers. Traveling to
              hundreds of cities with a full-time ministry team of as many as 75
              people, over twenty trailers, and dozens of tents, Frontline
              conducted thousands of evangelistic outreaches, focusing primarily
              on large gospel tent meetings, open-air meetings, street
              witnessing, and door-to-door community evangelism.

              />
            </div>
            <p class="mb-20">
              In the year 2000, the ministry leadership moved to establish a
              permanent base in order to ensure future growth and a wider
              ministry impact. The Frontline Ministry Center was established in
              San Pablo City, Laguna, and now serves as a center for training
              and ministry development with a continued emphasis on
              discipleship, leadership development, and teamwork, all relative
              to evangelizing and impacting the nation with the gospel of Jesus
              Christ.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-20">
              Over the past 15 years, Frontline has developed into a
              multi-faceted ministry, committed to a transformation that
              includes all aspects of life and society through an increased
              number of socially-engaging approaches, all being compassionate
              and evangelistic in nature. Frontline now has a growing network of
              vibrant, community-engaged churches (Frontline Worship Center), a
              registered Christian school (Frontline Christian Academy, Inc.), a
              registered child care program to abandoned, abused, or dangerously
              neglected children (Face the Children), and several social
              enterprise undertakings. All of these efforts are carried out by
              full-time and part-time ministry workers, both paid and volunteer.
