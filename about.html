            <p class="mb-20">
              The Philippine Frontline Ministries, Inc. (or the Frontline),
              founded and led by Jeff and Rowena Pessina, has been serving the
              Filipino people and nation for over 30 years. From humble
              beginnings of just a few young people armed with little more than
              vision and faith, Frontline has reached millions of people
              throughout the nation with the Gospel through a variety of means.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-20">
              For over 20 years Frontline travelled extensively in a mobile camp
              of tents and trailers, with a ministry team of as many as 75
              people, conducting gospel gatherings inside big-top tents. Beside
              the nightly gospel preaching, presentations were also made through
              drama skits, films, puppet shows, and music. The Frontline has
              seen hundreds of thousands of people respond to the gospel,
              receiving Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-20">
              In more recent years PFM has transitioned into a multi-faceted,
              center-based ministry, committed to social transformation and
              development, and nation-building through an increased number of
              approaches, all being compassionate and evangelistic in nature. We
              envision a nationwide network of reproducing churches and ministry
              centers where education, compassionate ministries to people in
              need, and personal development of young people are high-priority
              concerns.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-20">
              Through our first ministry center in San Pablo City, Laguna,
              Frontline now has a growing network of vibrant, community-engaged
              churches (Frontline Worship Center), a registered Christian school
              (Frontline Christian Academy, Inc.), a registered child care
              program to abandoned and abused children (Face the Children), and
              several social enterprise (or “business-as-ministry”) initiatives.
              All of these efforts are carried out by full-time and part-time
              ministry workers, both paid and volunteer.

          History of Philippine Frontline Ministries
        </h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p class="t-justify mb-20">
              The roots of the ministry go back to the late 1970's, when
              attempts were made by a ministry called Christ is the Answer
              Crusades (CITA) to establish a permanent work in this island
              nation of over 60 million people (over 100 million presently). For
              a number of reasons, both of these attempts failed.
            </p>
            <p class="t-justify mb-20">
              In 1980 Jeff Pessina was invited to the Philippines to assist in
              what would be the third attempt to establish a work in this
              nation. In the years that followed a small mission team was
              established with relative success. A number of evangelistic tent
              crusades were conducted in various towns and cities on the
              northern island of Luzon. However, in 1985, due again to
              financial, practical, and spiritual matters, the leader of the
              work decided to leave, and return to the USA. The team left behind
              was poorly equipped, under financed, and facing unlikely odds of
              successfully carrying on.
            </p>
            <p class="t-justify mb-20">
              However, the call of God to reach and impact the nation for Christ
              was real, and was not to be given up. Though facing many yet to be
              known trials and struggles in the days to come, Jeff assumed the
              leadership, began to rebuild, and lead the team to what eventually
              became an effective and established ministry named Philippine
              Frontline Ministries, Inc. (PFM). Registered officially in 1987,
              the "Frontline team" would go on to reach millions of Filipinos
              with the Gospel, and see many thousands commit their lives to
              Christ over the next 20 years.
            </p>
            <p class="t-justify mb-20">
              During these years the Frontline team lived on the road year-round
              in a mobile camp of tents and trailers. Traveling to hundreds of
              cities with a full time ministry team of as many as 75 people,
              over twenty trailers, and dozens of tents, Frontline conducted
              thousands of evangelistic outreaches, focusing primarily on large
              gospel tent meetings.

            />
            <p class="t-justify mb-20">
              In the year 2000, following the direction of God, the ministry
              moved to establish a permanent base in order to ensure future
              national impact. This was done in San Pablo City, Laguna. The
              Frontline mission center now serves as a center for training and
              ministry development with a continued emphasis on discipleship,
              leadership development, and teamwork, all relative to evangelizing
              the nation with the gospel of Jesus Christ. This move also opened
              doors to other exciting opportunities, such as a fast growing
              multi-site network of churches (Frontline Worship Center), a K-12
              school (Frontline Christian Academy, Inc.), jail and hospital
              outreach ministries, and a child rescue program known as Face the
              Children that is changing the lives of abused, abandoned, or
              dangerously neglected children. It also opened the opportunity to
              engage the needs of impoverished people through Christ-centered
              business and livelihood projects aimed at uplifting lives, and
              generating revenues to sow back into the spiritual and practical
              needs of the communities we serve through these ministries.
