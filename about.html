            <h2>A Brief History</h2>
            <p>
              The Philippine Frontline Ministries, Inc. (or the Frontline),
              founded and led by Jeff and Rowena Pessina, has been serving the
              Filipino people and nation for over 30 years. From humble
              beginnings of just a few young people armed with little more than
              vision and faith, Frontline has reached millions of people
              throughout the nation with the Gospel through a variety of means.
            </p>
            <p>
              For over 20 years Frontline travelled extensively in a mobile camp
              of tents and trailers, with a ministry team of as many as 75
              people, conducting gospel gatherings inside big-top tents. Beside
              the nightly gospel preaching, presentations were also made through
              drama skits, films, puppet shows, and music. The Frontline has
              seen hundreds of thousands of people respond to the gospel,
              receiving Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.
            </p>
            <p>
              In more recent years PFM has transitioned into a multi-faceted,
              center-based ministry, committed to social transformation and
              development, and nation-building through an increased number of
              approaches, all being compassionate and evangelistic in nature. We
              envision a nationwide network of reproducing churches and ministry
              centers where education, compassionate ministries to people in
              need, and personal development of young people are high-priority
              concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through our first ministry center in San Pablo City, Laguna,
              Frontline now has a growing network of vibrant, community-engaged
              churches (Frontline Worship Center), a registered Christian school
              (Frontline Christian Academy, Inc.), a registered child care
              program to abandoned and abused children (Face the Children), and
              several social enterprise (or “business-as-ministry”) initiatives.
              All of these efforts are carried out by full-time and part-time
              ministry workers, both paid and volunteer.
